The same applies on whether the user is allowed to manually pay an invoice for the said subscription. In these cases the Actionsets should make sure JFPORTAL is contacted via a POST if needed"

Then, if you would like to allow the users to cancel this subscription, select which actionset would perform the actions for that cancellation (JFPORTAL will only call this actionset and expect Infusionsoft to cancel the subscription). If you would like to allow users to also be able to manually pay subscription invoices for this subscription, select an actionset in the 'Invoice Payment Actionset' column. Note that JFPORTAL will attempt to make a payment automatically for the invoice when the user selects to, so the actionset does not have to do that."

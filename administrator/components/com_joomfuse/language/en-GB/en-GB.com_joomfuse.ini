This means that random pageviews may be randomly delayed due to the trigger of a cron job. Setting this option to 'No' means that you need to manually schedule a real server cronjob to visit the 'cronjob' view at least once a day so JoomFuse can execute all the time-consuming cronjobs then (index.php?option=com_joomfuse&view=cronjob). For more information, see the documentation"

COM_JOOMFUSE_CONFIG_ADVANCED_NUM_CHECK_CRON_DESCRIPTION="The more cron jobs execute per pageload, the slower the pageload. If you set this number too low and your amount of cronjobs is high, then in a low-traffic site you run the risk of creating a backlog of cronjobs that can end up delaying executions for days or months. Setting a value too high in a similar scenario may end up making the page unresponsive in the front end (expect every cron job to take 1-2 seconds to execute). If you have disabled the generic cronjob execution in the above option, you are advised to set a hight number here. Your only consideration should be any timeouts your webserver may encounter with large http delays. If you set this value to 0 you are essentially disabling cronjob execution"
